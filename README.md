# RedshiftKeys
Lightweight script to modify screen color temperature using hotkeys on Windows for people who don't like automatic temperature correction.

---

**How To Use**: Edit the script, modify the config section constants to change the configuration.

Variables (shift on/off, shift value) are stored in a .ini file by default to persist script & PC restarts.

**Note**: I made this for myself and upload it here in case anybody else wants to use it. Feel free to submit any issues or pull requests for bugs & features but no promises for delivery (other than large bugs).

### Requirements
* [AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com/download/)
